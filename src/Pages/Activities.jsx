          To date, we have been renting houses to provide a good home for a
          child or children. However, in the near future, we plan to possess our
          own facility and give a child with disabilities better amenities. Due
          to a mental illness called cerebral palsy, which their families have
          neglected, there are many homeless children in Nepal.
