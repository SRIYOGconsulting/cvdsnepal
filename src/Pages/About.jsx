            Our vision is to make children with disabilities capable of leading
            independent lives, empowering them through education, therapy, and
            skill development. We believe in creating a world where disability
            does not define one’s potential.

            Our mission is to remove social bias and provide equal opportunities

            fullest potential and contribute to Nepal’s inclusive development.
