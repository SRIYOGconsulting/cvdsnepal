      <h2>Welcome to [organizationName]</h2>
      <p> People with disability are the most vulnerable and
                    marginalized group of people. They live in isolation,
                    segregation, disparagement, poverty and virtual dependence
                    on charity and even pity. They are the victim of the
                    community misconception and stigmas denying them of their
                    inalienable and recognized rights. As a result, they shut
                    themselves from the world and they underestimate themselves
                    thinking that they do not fit in the society like other
                    able-bodied children.<br />

                    Thus, it becomes a painful reality how there is limited
                    involvement or we can find no involvement of their parents
                    or guardians in formulation and implementation of the
                    policies related to them. In addition, the programs
                    introduced by the Government have not benefitted them much.
                    Therefore, non-governmental organizations have been
                    providing care and different needed support activities
                    targeting people with disabilities.<br />

                    Conflict Victim and Disable Society ([organizationName]) is one of
                    these non- profit organizations located at Shankarapur
                    Municipality-6, Shalambutar,Sankhu,Kathmandu.This
                    organization has been devoting unceasingly with the aim of
                    supporting the people with disability in Nepal since 2005.
                    The organization has been providing food, clothes, shelter,
                    basic care and support to till date mentally and physically
                    disabled children through the ‘Rehabilitation Center for
                    Children with disability due to Cerebral Palsy (CP)’
                    project. <br /><br />
